> Hello!

I began programming as a hobby when I was **10 years old**, back in **2019**. Over time, I fell in love with **Java**, which has since become the language I'm **most skilled** in. While Java is my main focus, I'm also familiar with other **high-level languages** and constantly work to improve my **problem-solving skills**. I'm committed to strengthening my **weaknesses** and building on my **strengths**, both as a **developer** and as a **person**.

 I'm always eager to **explore new challenges**, but I believe in starting with a **strong foundation**. I aim to avoid **basic mistakes**, support others whenever I can, and never hesitate to **ask for help**
