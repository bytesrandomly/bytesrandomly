> Hello!

I began programming as a hobby when I was __10 years old__, back in __2019__. Over time, I fell in love with __Java__, which has since become the language I'm __most skilled__ in. While Java is my main focus, I'm also familiar with other __high-level languages__ and constantly work to improve my __problem-solving skills__. I'm committed to strengthening my __weaknesses__ and building on my __strengths__, both as a __developer__ and as a __person__.

 I'm always eager to __explore new challenges__, but I believe in starting with a __strong foundation__. I aim to avoid __basic mistakes__, support others whenever I can, and never hesitate to __ask for help__
